2-Bit Level Designer
---
*This project was intended to be a level designer for some kind of 2D rpg game I was also working on at the time. The level was split up in a large [quadtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree) and featured placement of individual pixels rather than traditional tile-based level design. Neither project is finished, and I have no plans to finish either in the near future. (By the way, the "2-bit" part of the name comes from this old idea I had to only use four colors in the entire game, but that got scrapped pretty quickly.)* -Me, 2015
